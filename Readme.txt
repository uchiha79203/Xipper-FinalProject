Xipper Version : 2.0 
----------------------------------
 Xipper is a file compression software based on the Huffman Algorithm.Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding
characters. 
The variable-length codes assigned to input characters are Prefix Codes, means the codes (bit sequences) are assigned in such a way that the code assigned to one character is not the prefix of code assigned to any other character. This is how Huffman Coding makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream. 
-----------------------------------
NOTE : Xipper Version 2.0 is currently capable of compressing only pure text files.
-----------------------------------
Updates : 
  ->Improved UI
  ->Optimized Compression
----------------------------------

Instructions to use: 
  ->Upload a text file(.txt) and click on compress button to perform compression on the uploaded file. The encoded file will be generated
    in the same folder where you have installed the application under the name of "encoded.xip".
  ->Upload a Xipper encoded file (.xip) file and click on decompress to perform the decompression. The decoded file will be generated in 
    the same folder where you have installed the application under the name of "decoded.txt".
