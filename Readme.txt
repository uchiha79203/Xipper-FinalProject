Xipper : 
----------------------------------
 - Xipper is a file compression software that combines security components along with compression. It utilizes the SHA-256 hash function to generate a unique hash for every message and applies the AES-128 algorithm
 over the compressed data to add a layer of security. 
 - It provides three options of three popular compression algorithms- Huffman, Shannon-Fano and LZW.

Instructions to use: 
  -> Go to "Xipper-Project"-> Run the "Xipper.exe"
  -> Click on "Browse" and select a TEXT(.txt) file.A sample "file.txt" can be used, which is available in the same folder.
  -> Select the Compression algorithm you want to apply over this file.
  -> You can compare the performances of all three algorithms by analysing the performance charts.
